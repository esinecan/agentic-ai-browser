# Playwright-LangChain Bot

## Overview
This project is a **modular, AI-driven web automation bot** that uses **Playwright** for browser interactions and **LangChain** for intelligent decision-making. It is designed for **reliable, verifiable web automation** with a structured execution flow.

## Features
- **Agentic Web Automation** ‚Äì Uses AI to decide and execute actions.
- **Modular Execution** ‚Äì Playwright-based browser control, with future support for CoPilotKit.
- **Action Verification** ‚Äì Ensures tasks (clicks, input, navigation) succeed before proceeding.
- **Memory & Context Awareness** ‚Äì Tracks task history and adapts based on past interactions.
- **Fully Containerized** ‚Äì Supports **Docker & Docker Compose** for easy deployment.
- **Configurable & Extendable** ‚Äì Environment settings in `.env`, modular architecture for scaling.

## Core Components

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Agentic Decision-Making**
The bot makes **real-time decisions** on:
- **Clicking elements**
- **Typing into inputs**
- **Navigating pages**
- **Extracting content**
- **Scrolling & waiting**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Modular Execution Layer**
- The browser interactions are handled in **`browserExecutor.ts`**.
- If Playwright becomes unreliable, **this can be swapped out without breaking logic**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Action Verification**
Each action is verified to ensure success:
- Clicks wait for **network idle**
- Inputs are **validated** after entry
- Navigation confirms the **URL change**

---

## Troubleshooting & Logs
- Logs are stored in `/logs` (or `./logs` locally).
- Screenshots are saved to `/screenshots` on failures.
- To debug:
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Future Plans
‚úÖ **Modular execution layer (DONE)**
‚úÖ **Action verification (DONE)**
üîú **CoPilotKit integration (Planned)**
üîú **Support for API-based automation**
