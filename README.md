Collecting workspace information# Agentic AI Browser

## Overview
This project is a **sophisticated (also pretty darn cool), AI-driven web automation agent** that uses **Playwright** for browser interactions and **LLM integration** for intelligent decision-making. It's designed for **reliable, adaptable web automation** with robust element detection and contextual understanding.

## Features
- **Agentic Web Automation** ‚Äì Uses AI to decide and execute actions based on page understanding
- **Intelligent Page Interpretation** ‚Äì Summarizes pages for better context and decision-making
- **Adaptive Element Detection** ‚Äì Handles different UI patterns across websites automatically
- **Action Verification & Recovery** ‚Äì Ensures actions succeed with smart fallbacks and alternative selectors
- **Context-Aware Interaction** ‚Äì Maintains task history and adapts based on successes and failures
- **Fully Containerized** ‚Äì Supports **Docker & Docker Compose** for easy deployment
- **Multi-LLM Support** ‚Äì Works with both **Gemini** and **Ollama** models for flexibility
- **Improved Resilience** ‚Äì Enhanced retry logic with increased attempt limits
- **Agent State Management** ‚Äì Track and control agent execution state
- **Manual Intervention** ‚Äì Ask for human help when the agent is stuck

## Core Components

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent Page Understanding**
The agent analyzes web pages at multiple levels:
- **Page Summarization** ‚Äì High-level description of the page purpose and structure
- **Element Detection** ‚Äì Identifies interactive elements across different implementation patterns
- **Context Preservation** ‚Äì Maintains awareness of past interactions and successes

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Adaptive Element Selection**
- Automatically detects alternative selectors when primary ones fail
- Handles different implementations of common UI patterns (search boxes, forms, etc.)
- Learns from successful interactions to improve future selections

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Action Execution & Verification**
Each action is executed with robust verification:
- Clicks wait for **network idle** and verify state changes
- Inputs are **validated** after entry with alternative strategies if needed
- Navigation confirms **URL change** and page load completion
- Automatic recovery with alternative selectors when primary ones fail
- Enhanced resilience with increased retry attempts

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Control**
- Stop the agent execution at any time with the `stopAgent()` function
- Request human intervention when the agent is stuck
- Agent state tracking for better control and monitoring

---

## Troubleshooting & Logs
- Logs are stored in logs directory with timestamps
- Screenshots are saved to screenshots on failures
- Page state snapshots are recorded before each action
- To debug with visual browser:
```sh
# Set in .env or use environment variable. It's much more fun to watch the model work IMO:
HEADLESS=false npm run dev
```

---

## LLM Configuration
The agent supports multiple LLM backends:

### Gemini
Using the advanced gemini-2.0-flash model:
```ini
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Ollama (Local)
```ini
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3
```
