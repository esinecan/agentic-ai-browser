# Agentic AI Browser

An automated browser agent powered by LLMs for web automation tasks.

## Overview
This project is a **AI-driven web automation agent** that uses **Playwright** for browser interactions and **LLM integration** for intelligent decision-making. It's designed for **reliable, adaptable web automation** with robust element detection and contextual understanding. It's single agent by design, and it doesn't require highly specialized models. Quite the opposite. It is built with getting solid benefit out of smaller models in mind. It can visit every single item in the first 5 search result pages, record its findings in a text file and notify you. You just talk to it in a natural speaking language.

## Features
- **Agentic Web Automation** – Uses AI to decide and execute actions based on page understanding
- **Intelligent Page Interpretation** – Summarizes pages for better context and decision-making
- **Adaptive Element Detection** – Handles different UI patterns across websites automatically
- **Action Verification & Recovery** – Ensures actions succeed with smart fallbacks and alternative selectors
- **Real-Time Visual Feedback** – Element highlighting and status overlay for transparency
- **Context-Aware Interaction** – Maintains task history and adapts based on successes and failures
- **Multi-LLM Support** – Works with both **Gemini**, **Ollama**, and **OpenAI** models for flexibility
- **Page Content Management** – Progressive scrolling and content extraction for text-heavy pages
- **Improved Resilience** – Enhanced retry logic with increased attempt limits
- **Agent State Management** – Track and control agent execution state
- **Manual Intervention** – Request human help when the agent is stuck
- **Session Notes** – Save and retrieve information across multiple pages during a session
- **Custom Automation Functions** – User-defined functions for common research and investigation tasks
- **Robust Browser Management** – Improved Chrome process handling with DevTools polling and cleanup

## Visual Feedback & Transparency

The agent now provides real-time visual feedback during automation:

### Element Highlighting
- **Red Border Highlighting** - Elements being interacted with are temporarily highlighted with a red border
- **Automatic Timeout** - Highlights automatically fade after interaction to avoid visual clutter
- **Error-Resistant Implementation** - Highlighting failures don't affect core functionality

### Status Overlay
- **Bottom-Left Status Display** - Non-intrusive overlay showing current agent action
- **Action-Specific Messages** - Context-aware status messages for clicks, typing, navigation, etc.
- **Success/Failure Indicators** - Visual confirmation when actions succeed or fail
- **Persistent Across Navigation** - Status overlay remains visible across page changes
- **Animation Effects** - Subtle animations make status changes noticeable without being distracting

### Benefits
- **Debugging Transparency** - Instantly see what the agent is doing and where it's focusing
- **Improved Observability** - No more wondering what action is currently being performed
- **User Confidence** - Clear visual indicators build trust in the agent's operation
- **Non-Invasive Design** - UI elements don't interfere with page functionality
- **Reduced Logging Need** - Visual feedback reduces the need to constantly check console logs

These visual feedback features make the agent significantly easier to monitor, debug, and trust during operation, especially in headful mode.

- **Progressive Content Loading**: Smart scrolling for text-heavy pages

#### Extraction Process:
1. **Initialization**: PageAnalyzer configures extraction parameters
2. **Extractor Selection**: Applicable extractors are selected based on configuration
3. **Parallel Processing**: Each extractor runs independently with timeout protection
4. **Result Aggregation**: Results are combined into a unified DOMSnapshot object
5. **Post-processing**: Elements are categorized and structured for easy access
6. **LLM Conversion**: Snapshot is transformed into LLM-friendly text representations

#### Integration Points:
- Powers the page interpretation system for LLM context
- Supports element selection and interaction strategies
- Provides structured data for verification and recovery systems
- Enables semantic understanding of page structure and content

### 2. Element Selection System
The system uses a strategy pattern to locate elements through multiple approaches, providing robust element detection across diverse web interfaces:

#### Strategy Architecture:
- **ElementFinder**: Core class that coordinates strategy selection and execution
- **BaseElementStrategy**: Abstract class with common utilities for all strategies
- **ElementContext**: Shared context object for tracking attempts and timeouts
- **Strategy Registry**: Manages strategies with automatic priority sorting

#### Selection Strategies (in priority order):
1. **DirectSelectorStrategy (100)**: Tries the exact selector provided
2. **IdSelectorStrategy (90)**: Specializes in ID-based selectors with high-confidence matching
3. **InputPatternStrategy (70)**: Uses common input field patterns across websites
4. **LinkStrategy (65)**: Special handling for link elements with href attributes
5. **RoleBasedStrategy (60)**: Uses ARIA roles and accessibility properties
6. **SingleElementStrategy (40)**: Last-resort fallback for simple pages

#### Key Features:
- **Prioritized Execution**: Tries strategies in order of likelihood of success
- **Independent Error Handling**: Failures in one strategy don't affect others
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Adapts to different page structures automatically
- **Alternative Suggestions**: When no match is found, suggests alternatives
- **Performance Optimization**: Early termination once element is found
- **Smart Timeouts**: Distributes available time across applicable strategies
- **Diagnostics**: Provides detailed logs about element finding attempts
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Works reliably across different browser engines

#### Selection Process:
1. **Initialization**: `elementFinder.findElement()` is called with an action
2. **Strategy Filtering**: Only strategies that can handle the action type are considered
3. **Prioritized Execution**: Each applicable strategy is tried in priority order
4. **Element Detection**: First strategy to find a matching element returns it
5. **Fallback Mechanism**: If direct selectors fail, tries alternative approaches
6. **Alternative Generation**: If all strategies fail, provides suggestions

#### Integration Points:
- Used by BrowserExecutor for all element interactions
- Powers the verification system for checking action success
- Enables dynamic recovery from selector changes or failures
- Supports automated element suggestion when original selectors fail

### 3. Action Execution Pipeline
