Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the user intent** ‚Äî determine what kind of content they are looking for (e.g., news, videos, images, scholarly articles, etc.).\n\n2. **Extract key search terms** ‚Äî identify the nouns and important context words. Clean the phrasing to make an effective search string.\n\n3. **Infer time range** ‚Äî Look for phrases like 'in 2022', 'past week', 'last month', or specific dates. Convert this to a Google `tbs` format such as:\n   - `tbs=qdr:w` ‚Üí past week\n   - `tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/01/2022,cd_max:12/31/2022` ‚Üí custom date range\n\n4. **Identify search type** ‚Äî Determine if the query is about:\n   - News ‚Üí `tbm=nws`\n   - Images ‚Üí `tbm=isch`\n   - Videos ‚Üí `tbm=vid`\n   - Books ‚Üí `tbm=bks`\n\n5. **Check for regional relevance** ‚Äî if the prompt includes a country (like Turkey, Japan, etc.), include `cr=countryXX` (e.g., `cr=countryTR` for Turkey).\n\n6. **Construct the full Google Search URL**:\n   - Base: `https://www.google.com/search`\n   - Add the query as `q=...` (URL-encoded)\n   - Add parameters like `tbs`, `tbm`, and optionally `cr` or `lr` as appropriate\n\n7. Once you've built the URL, navigate to it.\n\nüí° **One-shot example**\nUser prompt: \"find me news stories of hotels and expensive housing being built in forest fire areas in Turkey in the year of 2021\"\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Constructed URL:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=hotels+expensive+housing+forest+fire+Turkey&tbm=nws&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/01/2021,cd_max:12/31/2021&cr=countryTR\n\nNow go to this URL."

For instance if it's a code library, I'd first go to api docs of it to form a base understanding, then maybe look at stackoverflow or smth to see how people use it, then search it on google.com and look at top two results. I'd take notes in between. But if it's a memetic trend, I might look at knowourmeme, write notes, and then do a search on google.com etc. I want you to extrapolate these few shot examples and research the jargon of ${topicOrArea}, and whenever you visit a new source, if you're able to add items to glossary, I want you to write it down in the notes, and then move on to next source. Look at a few places, do some general or specific search on google, click on and read through first 5 results completely, really research the whole thang. take notes so that I can just read it and learn all I need.

But if there isn't something very close, simply generalize from ${myUseCase} incrementally, performing multiple searches if necessary. Once you have accumulated enough info create a very detailed step by step guide by writing it down via notes action. Feel free to take up to four sequential actions (I suggest you use first turn for making a 3 section plan, then each oof the rest for a section) to prepare the write up.
